# ADP_GPT_Phase1_Project

Dashboard Ideas:
  - Update or delete buttons on each customer record card
  - Separate page to add new customer or update existing customer
  - Search for customer functionality
  - Navigation bar with routing
  - Additional attributes such as salary, job title, benefits for each customer

Functionality Ideas:
  - CI/CD pipeline (very simplistic, mostly for continuous deployment)
  - Deployment on render or vercel
  - Database MongoDB or Postgres

Requirements: 
  - Add/Update/Remove customer functionality
  - Separate forms for Add/Update (does not require a new page, but would be simplest)
  - Three buttons in form, Save/Cancel/Delete
